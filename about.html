                                <br><br><span id="dear">Dear Kobe, </span> <br> <br>You have been a huge influence on my life since childhood. I remember watching the Lakers win the championship in 2009 and being completely infatuated with your game. How you approached the game of basketball has always been something special to watch. Your work ethic was unmatched, not only with basketball, but in life as well. The way you have influenced the world is truly something beautiful to witness. 
                                <br> <br>
                                Hearing kids yell Kobe as they throw things has always brought joy to my heart, however, now it will be accompanied by small amount of sadness as you are no longer with us. You gave basketball everything you had and the effect you had will never be forgotten. You will be the a symbol that will inspire generations to come. Videos of your games and style will be analyzed for years and will become something for kids to aspire towards. 
                                <br> <br>
                                Although your contribution to the game can not be quantified, what was really an inspiration was watching what you did after retirement. You became an advocate for women athletes and were actively trying to improve the world that your daughters were growing up in. You gave back to the youth, and provided tips and pointers to anyone who asked. You may have been a cold blooded competitor on the court, but off the court you were a loving husband, father, friend, and idol. You showed the world that one can be both ruthless and caring at the same time. You became a successful writer and inspirational speaker. Proving that you were more than just an athlete. You set a precedent that children do not have to choose between athletics or academics.  
                                <br> <br>
                                I always dreamed of meeting you some day and nervously telling you how much you have influenced my life. I always imagined going to one of your book signings and getting a picture with one of my idols. Telling you how appreciative I was for all the lessons I have gained from you. Telling you how I watched as many of your games as possible. Then sadly counting down the games left of your final season. I remember where I was when you played your last game. I remember the excitement of counting every point of your final 60 point game and getting into an arguement when my friends wanted to change to the warriors game during commercial break as I did not want to miss a second of it. I remember the sadness when it was finally over, and now an even greater sadness upon the realization that you are gone forever. This world lost such an amazing man and my hearts and prayers go out his family and loved ones.
